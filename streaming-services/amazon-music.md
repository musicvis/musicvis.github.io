# Recommendations

On side, seem basic. I listened to a song on In Rainbows. Customers also listened to Kid A. Big whoop.

# Radio

Playlists for artist, genre
eg. 90's hip hop, how do you want it, forgot about dre, baby got back

Top Hip Hop
started with G-Eazy, thumbs down

# Social

Doesn't feel very social, where is my profile, not really expressing my taste, just a customer of Amazon's catalog
How do I see what I have thumbed up and down so far
Where is everyone else? No people

# Web Player

* Easy to use, no frustration
* Liked design better than Google Material Design
* Search bar has no album art to let you know right thing, more like a search engine
