Hadn't started iTunes in a long time

Where is Apple Music? Googled for it since I didn't see it in iTunes

Cost 9.99 a month


iCloud music library

Onboarding
- Choose Music I Love word clouds with names of genres and artists
- Recommends playlists instantly out of box
Hip Hop R&B Hits of 1999. Destiny's Child Bills Bills Bills
    - Sound quality seemed a little better
    - Back the Azz Up, Bling Bling
    - Vivrant Thing! fun list


Desktop UI - shitty?
    - how do I say I love a song? A more menu, multiple clicks
    - Just loved a song, where is visual indicator that I loved it?
        - Oh I have to right click and see the word loved with a checkbox next to it

Scrobbling

Last.fm Desktop App - Scrobbles from iTunes and Windows Media Player - haven't heard that name in a while.


# What new music did I actually discover? Examples

The Rapture - House of Jealous Lovers
Right clicked love, now what will that do? What other actinos should I take? Add to Library for tracks, Add to playlist, single track
Go to Album

Couldn't add to playlist unless i merged with iCloud Music Library, did some matching with iTunes library. Wasn't as clear when performing an actual on an entire album. 
- Play next on menu, did nothing? Oh Queue lit up, click that and see music queue.

Queue is better than Spotify, little more freestyle DJ than just a playlist

Weird how much they crammed in this long bar. Click a thing that looks like bullet points, and you see Up Next, History, and Lyrics?

Lyrics feature is nice. Very plain and easy to read. Can't copy paste or save them somewhere. Have to be in iTunes to see the damn words.

Clear the queue was buggy. Cleared, says 43 songs instead of 0. THen 12 actual songs in list instead of 43.

Okay, what else should I do? Add similar artists too.
-> Albums you may also like. Didn't have artists you will also like. Would rather have a list of different songs from different albums in a playlist below, rather than clicking to each individual album. 

First album it said I may also like was 

Honestly can't tell who is artist or album name on album screen.

Didn't like King of France. Album recommendation was bad.

Artist page shows similar artists. I get it.

The Rapture's artist page doesn't show similar artists....

Checked the Lyrics to Losing My Edge, there was a transcriptino error
I would help correct it if they offered any tools like Rap Genius where I could suggest or edit something

Would be cool if it highlighted the lyrics karaoke style as song was playing

Unique / Distinguishing

Siri - useful in car, desktop integration with OS X
